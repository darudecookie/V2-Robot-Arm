basically i need to send an array of seven floats to in both directions a lot, so i think it might be useful to create a protocol for that



the idea is that if you want to joint hold or toggle some param you can send just your cmd and dont have the extra overhead of processing an arg 
in writing this i realize it might be faster to push arg processing onto the individual func that processes the arg but idk

so my message can be up to 30 chars long
 -first char (command) identifies the command for the mcu
 - next 29 chars (arg) are optional and used to pass arguments for commands

arg for 7 floats:
- i know values are probably going to be between -180 and 180, and i want probably 3 decimal points, so i could used fixed-point and have it in like 3 bytes/floats
- each byte can be 0-255 so i can use one byte per 2 decimal places
- in fixed point i can have a num between -180 and 180 w/ four decimal places w/ 3 bytes 
- byte 1: basically int8_t that handles whole number portion
